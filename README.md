Requires Python3, PIP, and installation of the following modules:

`$ pip install Pillow`  

`$ pip install urllib3`  

Drop your EXIF GPS-enabled photos into the /img folder and run the script (in terminal):  

`$ python3 travel-exif.py`

Once the script has looped through all the images in the directory, you should find .txt and .html files that contain a listing of the images with their respective locations. This [sample travel page](https://femmebot.github.io/travel-exif/) was generated using the .html file snippet generated by the python script.
